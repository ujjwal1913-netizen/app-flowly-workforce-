/**
 * Navigation state context — changes on every page navigation.
 *
 * **Provider:** `AppBusinessLayer`
 *
 * **Change frequency:** HIGH — updates whenever the user navigates to a
 * different view or opens/closes a page modal.
 *
 * Holds the currently active view ID, breadcrumb trail, view error states,
 * and the page-modal machinery.
 *
 * **Hooks:**
 * - `useAppViewId()` — current route view ID
 * - `useAppRendered()` — whether the current view has finished rendering
 * - `useOnRendered()` — callback to mark rendering complete
 * - `useAppendBreadcrumb()` — push a view onto the breadcrumb trail
 * - `useBreadcrumb()` — the breadcrumb trail (optional, no throw)
 * - `useViewErrorStatus()` — memoized `{ notFound, deleted }`
 * - `useOpenPageModal()` — open a view in a modal overlay
 * - `useOpenModalViewId()` — the view ID currently shown in the modal
 * - `useViewObjectPermission()` — canonical permission for an active view
