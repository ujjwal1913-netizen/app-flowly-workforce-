Feature: Eva page action permissions
  These scenarios create isolated Custom spaces for Eva and verify page action menus
  for canonical Full access, Can edit, and Can view permissions. Explicit page grants
  overriding inherited space access are covered by the space group permission feature.

  Background:
    Given a temporary Eva page action permission fixture exists

  Scenario: Eva sees permission-specific sidebar more actions
    Given I sign in as seeded Eva
    When I open Eva's sidebar more menu for "Grante full access for eva"
    Then Eva's sidebar more menu shows only "Rename, Change icon, Lock page, Duplicate, Move to, Delete, Open in a new tab"
    When I close Eva's sidebar more menu
    And I open Eva's sidebar more menu for "Edit only permission for eva"
    Then Eva's sidebar more menu shows only "Rename, Change icon, Lock page, Duplicate, Open in a new tab"
    When I close Eva's sidebar more menu
    And I open Eva's sidebar more menu for "Read only permission for eva"
    Then Eva's sidebar more menu shows only "Open in a new tab"

  Scenario: Eva sees permission-specific page more actions
    Given I sign in as seeded Eva
    When I open Eva's page "Grante full access for eva"
    And I open Eva's page more menu
    Then Eva's page more menu shows only "Lock page, Duplicate, Move to, Find and replace, Delete, Version history"
    When I close Eva's page more menu
    And I open Eva's page "Edit only permission for eva"
    And I open Eva's page more menu
    Then Eva's page more menu shows only "Lock page, Duplicate, Find and replace, Version history"
    When I close Eva's page more menu
    And I open Eva's page "Read only permission for eva"
    And I open Eva's page more menu
    Then Eva's page more menu shows only "Find and replace"

  Scenario: A space member sees neither Manage Space nor Duplicate Space
    Given I sign in as seeded Eva
    When I inspect Eva's temporary permission space actions
    Then Eva's temporary permission space more actions button is hidden
