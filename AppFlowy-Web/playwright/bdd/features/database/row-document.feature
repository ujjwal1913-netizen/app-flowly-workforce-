Feature: Database row document
  Row document content should be reflected in the database primary cell.
  Inline grids duplicated inside row pages should become independent databases.

  Scenario: Image link content shows the row document indicator
    Given a board database with a card is open
    When I add image link "https://example.com/row-page-image.png" to the card row page
    And I close the card row page
    Then the card primary cell shows a row document icon
    When I switch the database to a new Grid view
    Then the grid primary cell shows a row document icon

  Scenario: Row document indicator synchronizes to another Board client
    Given a board database with a card is open
    And another web client opens the same card Board
    Then the other web client shows no row document icon for the card
    When I add image link "https://example.com/synced-row-page-image.png" to the card row page
    And I close the card row page
    Then the other web client shows exactly one row document icon for the card

  Scenario: A newly ordered card reconciles its row document metadata without reload
    Given a board database is open before the synchronized card is created
    And another web client opens the Board before the synchronized card is created
    When I create the synchronized card
    Then the other web client shows no row document icon for the card
    When I add image link "https://example.com/newly-ordered-row-page-image.png" to the card row page
    And I close the card row page
    Then the other web client shows exactly one row document icon for the card

  Scenario: Every newly ordered card reconciles its row document metadata without reload
    Given a board database is open before three synchronized cards are created
    And another web client opens the Board before the synchronized card is created
    When I create three synchronized cards
    Then the other web client shows no row document icons for the synchronized cards
    When I add row page content to all three synchronized cards
    Then the other web client shows exactly three synchronized cards with document icons without reload

  Scenario: Duplicating an inline grid block in a row page creates an independent database
    Given a grid database is open for row-page inline grid duplication
    When I open the first row as a full row page
    And I create an inline grid in the row page
    And I duplicate the inline grid block in the row page
    Then the duplicated inline grid shows a loading placeholder
    And the duplicated inline grid has fresh view and database ids
    When I edit the duplicated inline grid
    Then the original row-page inline grid remains unchanged
    When I edit the original inline grid
    Then the duplicated row-page inline grid remains unchanged

  # Same as above, but the outer database is itself an inline grid embedded in a
  # document, reproducing the exact reported folder shape:
  # document -> parent grid -> row page -> inline subgrid.
  Scenario: Duplicating an inline grid block in the row page of a document-embedded grid creates an independent database
    Given a document is open for row-page inline grid duplication
    And I create a parent inline grid in the document
    When I open the first parent grid row as a full row page
    And I create an inline grid in the row page
    And I duplicate the inline grid block in the row page
    Then the duplicated inline grid shows a loading placeholder
    And the duplicated inline grid has fresh view and database ids
    When I edit the duplicated inline grid
    Then the original row-page inline grid remains unchanged
    When I edit the original inline grid
    Then the duplicated row-page inline grid remains unchanged
