Feature: Number grouping matches Desktop
  Numbers can be grouped by their exact numeric value or by configured ranges.
  A range includes its lower bound, and only the final range includes its upper bound.

  Scenario: Default ranges separate zero, boundaries, outliers, and missing values
    Given a Grid contains the following numbers for number grouping
      | value   |
      | -1      |
      | 0       |
      | 10      |
      | 90      |
      | 100     |
      | 101     |
      | <empty> |
    When I group the Grid by its number field
    Then number grouping uses Range with Start "0", End "100", and Interval "10"
    And the number groups contain these row counts
      | bucket    | rows |
      | empty     | 1    |
      | < 0       | 1    |
      | [0, 10)   | 1    |
      | [10, 20)  | 1    |
      | [90, 100] | 2    |
      | > 100     | 1    |
    When I show empty number groups
    Then the number groups contain these row counts
      | bucket   | rows |
      | [20, 30) | 0    |
      | [30, 40) | 0    |
      | [40, 50) | 0    |
      | [50, 60) | 0    |
      | [60, 70) | 0    |
      | [70, 80) | 0    |
      | [80, 90) | 0    |
    When I reload the number-grouped Grid
    Then number grouping uses Range with Start "0", End "100", and Interval "10"
    And the number groups contain these row counts
      | bucket    | rows |
      | [20, 30)  | 0    |
      | [90, 100] | 2    |
      | > 100     | 1    |
    When I hide empty number groups
    Then the number group "[20, 30)" is not displayed
    And the number groups contain these row counts
      | bucket  | rows |
      | empty   | 1    |
      | [0, 10) | 1    |

  Scenario: Exact values merge decimal spellings and sort numerically after reopening
    Given a Grid contains the following numbers for number grouping
      | value   |
      | 1       |
      | 1.0     |
      | 1.00    |
      | 2       |
      | 10      |
      | -2      |
      | 0       |
      | <empty> |
    When I group the Grid by its number field
    And I select Exact value number grouping
    Then the number groups contain these row counts
      | bucket | rows |
      | empty  | 1    |
      | = -2   | 1    |
      | = 0    | 1    |
      | = 1    | 3    |
      | = 2    | 1    |
      | = 10   | 1    |
    And the displayed number groups are ordered as follows
      | bucket |
      | empty  |
      | = -2   |
      | = 0    |
      | = 1    |
      | = 2    |
      | = 10   |
    When I sort number groups descending
    And I reload the number-grouped Grid
    Then Exact value number grouping is selected
    And the displayed number groups are ordered as follows
      | bucket |
      | empty  |
      | = 10   |
      | = 2    |
      | = 1    |
      | = 0    |
      | = -2   |
    When I sort number groups ascending
    Then the displayed number groups are ordered as follows
      | bucket |
      | empty  |
      | = -2   |
      | = 0    |
      | = 1    |
      | = 2    |
      | = 10   |

  Scenario: Signed decimal ranges use exact boundaries and a shortened final bucket
    Given a Grid contains the following numbers for number grouping
      | value   |
      | -0.6    |
      | -0.5    |
      | -0.3    |
      | 0       |
      | 0.5     |
      | 0.6     |
      | 0.7     |
      | <empty> |
    When I group the Grid by its number field
    And I apply number ranges with Start "-0.5", End "0.6", and Interval "0.2"
    And I show empty number groups
    Then the number groups contain these row counts
      | bucket       | rows |
      | empty        | 1    |
      | < -0.5       | 1    |
      | [-0.5, -0.3) | 1    |
      | [-0.3, -0.1) | 1    |
      | [-0.1, 0.1)  | 1    |
      | [0.1, 0.3)   | 0    |
      | [0.3, 0.5)   | 0    |
      | [0.5, 0.6]   | 2    |
      | > 0.6        | 1    |
    When I reload the number-grouped Grid
    Then number grouping uses Range with Start "-0.5", End "0.6", and Interval "0.2"
    And the number groups contain these row counts
      | bucket       | rows |
      | [-0.3, -0.1) | 1    |
      | [0.5, 0.6]   | 2    |
      | > 0.6        | 1    |

  Scenario: Invalid range drafts cannot replace the saved configuration
    Given a Grid contains the following numbers for number grouping
      | value |
      | -1    |
      | 1     |
      | 11    |
    When I group the Grid by its number field
    Then these invalid range drafts cannot be applied or saved
      | start | end  | interval |
      | 0     | 100  | 0        |
      | 0     | 100  | -1       |
      | 0     | 0    | 10       |
      | 100   | 0    | 10       |
      | nope  | 100  | 10       |
      | 0     | 1001 | 1        |
    When I reload the number-grouped Grid
    Then number grouping uses Range with Start "0", End "100", and Interval "10"
    And the number groups contain these row counts
      | bucket   | rows |
      | < 0      | 1    |
      | [0, 10)  | 1    |
      | [10, 20) | 1    |

  Scenario: Adding a row inside a range prefills that range's lower bound
    Given a Grid contains the following numbers for number grouping
      | value   |
      | 1       |
      | 11      |
      | <empty> |
    When I group the Grid by its number field
    And I add a row to number group "[10, 20)"
    Then the number groups contain these row counts
      | bucket   | rows |
      | [10, 20) | 2    |
    When I select Exact value number grouping
    Then the number groups contain these row counts
      | bucket | rows |
      | empty  | 1    |
      | = 1    | 1    |
      | = 10   | 1    |
      | = 11   | 1    |

  Scenario: Numeric group order stays independent of the primary row sort after reopening
    Given a Grid contains the following numbers for number grouping
      | value   |
      | 3       |
      | 4       |
      | 5       |
      | 6       |
      | <empty> |
    When I group the Grid by its number field
    And I apply number ranges with Start "1", End "5", and Interval "2"
    And I sort number groups ascending
    And I sort the Grid rows by its number field descending
    Then number grouping uses Range with Start "1", End "5", and Interval "2"
    And the displayed number groups are ordered as follows
      | bucket |
      | empty  |
      | [3, 5] |
      | > 5    |
    And the number groups contain these row counts
      | bucket | rows |
      | empty  | 1    |
      | [3, 5] | 3    |
      | > 5    | 1    |
    And number group "[3, 5]" contains numeric values in this order
      | value |
      | 5     |
      | 4     |
      | 3     |
    When I sort number groups descending
    And I sort the Grid rows by its number field ascending
    Then the displayed number groups are ordered as follows
      | bucket |
      | empty  |
      | > 5    |
      | [3, 5] |
    And number group "[3, 5]" contains numeric values in this order
      | value |
      | 3     |
      | 4     |
      | 5     |
    When I reload the number-grouped Grid
    Then number grouping uses Range with Start "1", End "5", and Interval "2"
    And the numeric row sort is ascending
    And the displayed number groups are ordered as follows
      | bucket |
      | empty  |
      | > 5    |
      | [3, 5] |
    And number group "[3, 5]" contains numeric values in this order
      | value |
      | 3     |
      | 4     |
      | 5     |
