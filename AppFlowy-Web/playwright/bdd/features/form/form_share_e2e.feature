Feature: Form Share End-to-End

  # These scenarios exercise real share settings against Cloud and verify
  # the respondent UI, submission result, or resulting database state.
  # The public-form API is never mocked.

  Scenario: Workspace-tier member submission stamps Eva as the respondent
    # New shares default to Workspace tier + anonymous=true. Nathan
    # explicitly disables anonymous responses before Eva opens the
    # form from a separate authenticated context.
    # Successfully loading and submitting this workspace-only form
    # proves that the cloud recognizes Eva as a workspace member.
    Given Nathan has a Grid with a Form tab open in his workspace
    When I add a "RichText" question
    And I open the share popover
    And I disable anonymous responses
    And I copy the share URL from the popover
    And Eva signs in and opens the captured share URL

    Then the public form body is visible
    When I fill the first text input with "workspace-identified-check"
    And I submit the public form
    Then the public form confirmation page is visible

    When I switch back to the authoring tab
    Then the source grid has at least 4 rows
    And the respondent for the row with name "workspace-identified-check" is Eva

  Scenario: Same share link can be used to post N responses in a row
    # Stress-test the idempotency-key rotation: a single tab on the
    # same share URL submits 5 responses back-to-back via the
    # "Submit another response" loop. Each click must produce a fresh
    # row in the source grid — neither the cloud's `(token, idempotency_key)`
    # dedup nor any local state leakage may swallow a submission.
    #
    # Default Grid seeds 3 rows; +5 submissions = 8 rows. The names
    # are sequenced (`multi-submit-N`) so each row is individually
    # verifiable.
    Given a Grid with a Form tab is open
    When I add a "RichText" question
    And I open the share popover
    And I switch the share tier to "public"
    And I copy the share URL from the popover
    And I open the share URL in a fresh anonymous tab

    Then the public form body is visible
    When I submit the public form 5 times with name prefix "multi-submit-"

    # All 5 submissions must have landed.
    When I switch back to the authoring tab
    Then the source grid has at least 8 rows
    And the respondent for the row with name "multi-submit-1" is anonymous
    And the respondent for the row with name "multi-submit-5" is anonymous

  Scenario: Submit another response lands a second row (idempotency key rotates)
    # Regression for the "submit again does nothing" symptom: the
    # `idempotencyKey` was initialized once on mount and reused on the
    # second submit, so the cloud's `(token, idempotency_key)` dedup
    # returned the original submission's id instead of writing a new
    # row. `handleSubmitAnother` now rotates the key.
    Given a Grid with a Form tab is open
    When I add a "RichText" question
    And I open the share popover
    And I switch the share tier to "public"
    And I copy the share URL from the popover
    And I open the share URL in a fresh anonymous tab

    Then the public form body is visible
    When I fill the first text input with "submit-another-first"
    And I submit the public form
    Then the public form confirmation page is visible

    # Click "Submit another response", fill and submit again from the
    # SAME respondent tab (same idempotency window if the key didn't
    # rotate).
    When I click submit another response
    Then the public form body is visible
    When I fill the first text input with "submit-another-second"
    And I submit the public form
    Then the public form confirmation page is visible

    # Both submissions must have landed — the source grid had 3 default
    # rows; +2 submissions = 5.
    When I switch back to the authoring tab
    Then the source grid has at least 5 rows
    And the respondent for the row with name "submit-another-first" is anonymous
    And the respondent for the row with name "submit-another-second" is anonymous

  Scenario: Public-tier anonymous submission lands as Anonymous and adds a row
    # Reciprocal of the identified path. Switching to Public forces
    # anonymous=true cloud-side; submitting from a fresh BrowserContext
    # ensures no session leaks. Both pieces required for the privacy
    # contract: Public never stamps an identified respondent even if
    # the browser is signed in elsewhere.
    Given a Grid with a Form tab is open
    When I add a "RichText" question
    And I open the share popover
    And I switch the share tier to "public"
    And I copy the share URL from the popover
    And I open the share URL in a fresh anonymous tab

    Then the public form body is visible
    When I fill the first text input with "public-anon-check"
    And I submit the public form
    Then the public form confirmation page is visible

    When I switch back to the authoring tab
    # Source grid had 3 default rows; the submission adds the 4th.
    Then the source grid has at least 4 rows
    And the respondent for the row with name "public-anon-check" is anonymous

  Scenario: Workspace anonymous visitor reaches login and Closed tier blocks submission
    # Two unsubmittable states in one scenario. The popover doesn't
    # need to change for the workspace-anon case (default mint =
    # workspace tier, anonymous responder = no session). For Closed
    # we flip the tier through the popover then re-visit the same URL.
    Given a Grid with a Form tab is open
    When I open the share popover
    And I copy the share URL from the popover
    And I open the share URL in a fresh anonymous tab
    Then the public form shows the login required prompt
    And the public form offers login and sign up
    When I choose to log in from the public form
    Then the public form respondent sees the login form
    And authentication will return to the public form

    # Now flip to Closed and reload the public URL. The existing link
    # surfaces "no longer accepting"; no new respondent row is created.
    When I switch back to the authoring tab
    And I switch the share tier to "closed"
    Then the access banner reflects the "closed" tier
    When I open the share URL in a fresh anonymous tab
    Then the public form shows the closed page

  Scenario: Form builder with no questions yields an empty public form
    # Regression for the "shared link still shows every database field
    # even though the Form-builder UI says 'No questions yet'" bug.
    #
    # The scenario setup runs `dismissAutoCreateDialogIfPresent`,
    # which clicks "Start from
    # scratch" on the auto-create modal. That click writes the
    # `__form_decided__` sentinel into the form view's
    # `form_field_settings` map — exactly the state the user-reported
    # bug starts from. We then NEVER call "I add a ... question".
    #
    # Before the cloud projection fix, the public schema fell through
    # to the legacy default-include behavior and exposed every database
    # property (Name / Type / Done for the default seed). After the fix,
    # the sentinel's presence flips the projection to opt-in semantics,
    # and the public form lands with zero question cards.
    Given a Grid with a Form tab is open
    When I open the share popover
    And I switch the share tier to "public"
    And I copy the share URL from the popover
    And I open the share URL in a fresh anonymous tab

    Then the public form body is visible
    And the public form has no question cards
